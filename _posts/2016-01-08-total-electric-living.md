Pastor Hill's infatuation with a young parishioner leads him down a darkly comic path of ineptitude, including the accidental murder of a church elder, theft of $752,327.25, and kidnapping; setting in motion farcical events. To keep authorities from discovering his crimes, and their illegal exotic bird trade, church elders hire an assassin, only to end up with the contract-murder firm's frustrated call center operator, Guinevere Liddle, who escapes her stunted life by mimicking the protagonist in her favorite blockbuster film franchise, "Femme Deadly." Meanwhile, her ex-employers enlist their top clean-up hitman, who's preoccupied with getting his mentor into an assisted living facility.
